### Empowering the Backbone of Our Community
Women are the heart of Kilifi South. Our leadership ensures they are supported through:

* **Financial Inclusion**: Supporting table banking and micro-finance initiatives for women-led small businesses.
* **Education**: The **Empower Her Initiative** focuses on keeping girls in school and providing mentorship for female leaders.
* **Leadership Roles**: Ensuring fair representation of women in all community decision-making committees.
